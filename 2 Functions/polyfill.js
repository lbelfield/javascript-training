// polyfill: concept -> Browser compatibility
// JS is a world of addition, nothing gets deprecated because 90's page needs to still work. 
// Deprecation resolved because backwards compatible.
// Not new versions are guaranteed across browsers until they update them... 
// ie you can't get new features on a browser that hasn't updated to the new 
// THE POLYFILL EXTENDS THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE BROWSERS THAT ARE BEHIND
// You can customise the polyfill in the config to pull in only what you need
// eg you can pull in everything for maintenance or pull in YAGNI for performance.
