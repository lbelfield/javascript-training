// Object Fundamentals:
// Object has a key inside it called a PROTOTYPE.
// Prototype is used for inheritance.
// ES2016 introduced Classes which are better for Inheritance and make use of Prototype.
// Class inherits from its base class, Object
// Prototype needs to be declared before the instance is called.
