// No need to manage lists because the engine does that for you
// Can do everything with objects and arrays
// js scripting and business logic; use cases for what to do use. 
// Very strong at doing what it does eg Node as a server; more efficient than Python

// Cheat Sheet: Rule of thumb

// Arrays - Collection (look for data, loop)
// Sets - Distinct set of elements (never loop)

// Object - Description of an entity where relationship exists
// Maps - Store in a Database (key value) - If we had to create a Redis using JavaScript. Infinite keys. No relationship.
